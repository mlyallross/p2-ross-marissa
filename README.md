Issues:
I had a lot of issues with the API part of the assignment. I spent at least 20 hours trying to find one other than the one we had used in the homework. Unfortuantely, I wasn't able to make any of them successful. The biggest problem I had was trying to find one that was just http instead of https. I tried to make at least 10 different https ones work but I am thinking it didn't because I was only working locally on my computer. I tried to do an Instagram API but couldn't figure out how to do it. Every one I found was an https. I also tried to do a moon phase one that didn't work - I used RapidAPI and it said I maxed out my requests or something but it was also an https and I couldn't get that one to work either.
